# ML1_Lab2
Machine Learning 1 Lab 2 Assignment for SMU MS in Data Science
This project is Team 2's analysis and modeling of the Yelp dataset in Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset

We will also use Google colab to co-author the final notebook.
Lab 2 Focus:  Classification and/or Regression of two different responses in the same dataset.
We have chosen to:
1.  Classify:  good_score
    stars < 4 is False
    stars >=4 is True
    
2.  Regression:  review_count
    This is a continuous parameter, so the model will attempt to predict review_count based on the different factors in the dataset.
